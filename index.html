                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>It was the New Year holidays of 2012 in the Russian city of Yakutsk (the coldest city in the world). Temperatures dropped below –45°C. This meant that people were more likely to use taxis. Taxi companies in the city saw this as an opportunity to raise their prices to unaffordable levels. The students in the city were very upset with this. So they decided to create their own ride-hailing group on the Russian social network known as VK. They named the group Independent Drivers (indrivers). Members of the group would publish their routes and how much they were willing to pay. After that drivers would contact them and complete their requests. Just six months later the group already had 60 000 members (and that number continued to grow every day). One year after its creation, the group transitioned to the Sinet company which created a high-tech peer-to-peer transportation service based on the group's model. This is how inDriver was born. So as you can see, inDriver started as a group which stood against the inflexible authority of centralised taxi services. And it continues to stand against them to this day.</p>

            <p>inDriver operates in the largest metropolitan areas with the highest levels of competition. It also operates in small villages with a population of between just seven to eight-thousand residents (which often have very weak internet connections and no maps). We are therefore proven to be able to successfully adapt to the needs of residents of any village, town or city. Today, inDriver is one of the top-5 international passenger-services worldwide. The company continues its active international expansion, providing an increasing number of users with the opportunity to determine their optimal travel terms and protecting them from price manipulation.</p>
